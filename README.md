# Data structures
this project contains examples of data structures to help me understand them better
    
## Linked list
each element points to the next one

## Queue
linear structure which follows First In First Out (FIFO) order

## Stack 
linear structure which follows Last In First Out (LIFO) order

## Dynamic array
automatically grows when we try to make an insertion and there is no more space left for the new item

## Binary tree
TODO - traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder)

## Graph
TODO - add edge, add vertex

## Heap
TODO

## Hash table
TODO
